\title{Chaotic beam data}
\concept{simulated time series}
\description{A flexible thin steel beam was mounted vertically to a
electromechanical shaker which provided a transverse
sinusoidal excitation.  The beam tip was placed near two rare
earth magnets so as to provide nonlinear buckling forces. The
beam was treated with a viscoelastic strip adhered to one side
to provide a little damping. The addition of the damping
treatment helps to form a more distinguishable fractal
structure in phase space embeddings.  A laser vibrometer was
used to record the beam tip velocity and the analog signal
streamed to a National Instruments data acquisition board. The
data was sampled at 1000 Hz. The gain of excitation was adjusted
until (seemingly) chaotic motion was observed.}
